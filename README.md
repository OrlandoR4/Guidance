# Guidance

***(THIS IS NOT A STABLE RELEASE, STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE BE AWARE OF UPCOMING CHANGES)***

***(THIS VERSION OF GUIDANCE IS VERY OUTDATED, AN UP TO DATE VERSION IS IN DEVELOPMENT, USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK)***

Guidance is an experimental set of tools for physics simulations involving guidance, navigation, and control of rockets and rocket-related bodies. The main objective for this
program is to be modular and intuitive enough for anyone to modify and simulate their own systems in.

Guidance also features a data logging and data parsing module for processing and creating flight data files for analysis and visualization within Guidance or external programs.

As of now, Guidance requires understanding Matplotlib for data visualization within Guidance, exporting CSV data files for visualization in other programs is also an option.

***I don't assume any responsibility for anything flown or tested using this program, use and modify at your own risk.***
